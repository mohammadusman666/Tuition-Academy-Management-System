Tuition Academy Management System maintains the whole record of students like admission, fees, class and grades (result), and subjects offered by the academy. It also maintains the whole information on academy academic matters.

The system also maintains the different roles and responsibilities of Academy administration and
faculty. Teachersâ€™ receptionist and principal will have their own accounts and will be assigned
different responsibilities. Following are the roles and responsibilities of the people:

1. Manager: The system allows the manager to view the whole record of the student, fees, and staff
information and performance.
2. Teacher: The system allows the teacher to manage the whole record of students like quizzes,
assignments, midterms, and final exam marks. Add, update, and delete these records.
3. Admin: The system allows admin to add, delete, update, and view student record of
academic performance and his/her fees records.
